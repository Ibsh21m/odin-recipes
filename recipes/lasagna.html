    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>This is a special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
    <br>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be intimidated by all the layers of delicious Italian flavor — try this homemade lasagna recipe today!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Meat:</b> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><b>Onion:</b> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><b>Canned tomatoes:</b> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><b>Fresh herbs:</b> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><b>Spices and seasonings:</b> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Noodles:</b> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li><b>Cheese:</b> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs:</b> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and <b>SERVING.</b></li>
        </ol>
